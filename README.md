PowerChord adds a playable *Pan Flute* and *Harmonica*, which can be used to play notes and chords off of a chromatic scale using the pitch of the camera!

It also adds a selection of "Valley Spirits", which augment your chords in the offhand, giving them special AoE effects!

Features:

- Pan Flute & Harmonica play major and minor chords respectively
- Valley Spirits "sing backup" with a 4-chord progression - majors apply positives to players, minors apply negatives to hostiles.
- Preview HUD for selected chord, including the effect when sneaking
- Left-Click for instant chord, Right-Click for a single note, or hold right for the AoE effect "power chord"
- Harmonica plays chords faster, but takes longer to cool down.
- Completely component driven, for both instruments and "key" items.
